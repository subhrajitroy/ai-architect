# Use Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2023-08-15

## Context

Our application has been growing rapidly, and we're facing challenges with scalability, deployment, and team coordination. The monolithic architecture is becoming difficult to maintain as different parts of the application have different scaling needs and release cycles.

## Options Considered

1. Continue with the monolithic architecture but improve modularization
2. Adopt a microservices architecture
3. Implement a hybrid approach with a modular monolith that can be gradually broken into services

## Decision

We will build a modular monolith that can be gradually broken into services if required later.Modular monoliths are easier to maintain and reduce cognitive overhead.

## Technology Choices

* Docker for containerization
* Kubernetes for orchestration
* API Gateway (Kong) for routing and authentication
* Event-driven communication using Kafka for asynchronous operations
* MongoDB for services requiring flexible schema
* SqlServer for services with complex relational data
* Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
* Distributed tracing with Jaeger
